# Orthodrome Calculator

Calculator for the orthodrome (great circle) and loxodrome parameters for navigation purposes.

## Getting Started

```Orthodrome Calculator``` has been created in order to calculate several orthodrome/loxodrome 
parameters for the navigation purposes:
* all angles (ABC) and sides (abd) of the spherical triangle created from 2 given points and 
the North Pole.
* Orthodrome distance (in angle units as well as Nm/km)
* Orthodrome bearing angles (initial and final in angle units)
* Orthodrome vertices
* Loxodrome distance
* Orthodromic gain

### Installing & Using

Simply download the most recent executable [jar file](https://github.com/pChocz/orthodrome-calculator-javafx/raw/master/orthodrome-calculator_newest.jar)
and run it from your computer. Languages available to choose within the application are `EN` and `PL`.
